✅ 1. What is Props in React?

Props stands for "properties".
They are like arguments passed to a function, but here, you pass data to a component.

📦 Think of props as a way to send data from a parent component to a child component.

**✅ 2. Why do we use Props?**

We use props to:

    🔁 Reuse components with different data.

    📤 Send data from one component to another (usually Parent ➜ Child).

    🔍 Keep components dynamic and flexible.
